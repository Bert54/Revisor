Revisor/PL is a full java implementation of a tableaux-based Dalal revision operator.
You need Java Runtime Environment 1.7 (Java 7) or newer for Revisor/PL.

TestRevisorPL.java shows how you can easily perform adaptation and revision operations.

RevisorEnginePL.java contains functions to :
- parse formulas from strings
- perform adaptation and revision
- set weights of variables for adaptation and revision
- check entailment between formulas using tableaux

The revisorPL.pl package is not yet available in English : Commentaries, methods and variables 
names are still in French, but it is not required that you use them, as everything is accessible 
through RevisorPL.java.
