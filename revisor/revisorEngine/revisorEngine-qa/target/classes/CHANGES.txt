2.1.1 -- 11 May (?)

    - Many Algebra optimisations, some specific to INDU
    - Replaced PC1-inspired algebraic closure algorithms with PC2-VK (faster)
    - Implemented other closure algorithms (but they are not reachable in code)
    - Implemented explosion method (e.g. replacing "a(i+j)" with "a(i)" and
      "a(j)") and other methods related methods (they are not used in Revisor,
      but Craqpot calls them directly)
    - With respect to the previous point, "+" cannot be used in parameter names

2.1 -- 31 October 2013

    - Added classes and methods for Revisor/PCQA
    - Added options for backend debugging
    - More stringent rules for QCN syntax

2.0.2 -- 22 May 2013

    - Added reviseExhaustively and adaptExhaustively to return all
      possible scenarios at the minimal distance
    - Added closed set, which is important for "exhaustive" revision
    - Bug fix: the cost incurred by changes made through
      QCN::enforce_total_path_consistency was not taken into
      consideration when computing the g function
    
    /!\ Those features were not thoroughly tested. Consider using v2.0.1
        for use in a propduction environment

2.0.1 -- 21 May 2013

    - Bug fix: the iterative algorithm was used instead of A*
    - Bug fix: the server went on after the client had timed out
    - Bug fix: asking to print a non-existent QCN crashed the server

2.0 -- 13 April 2013

    - No change to Revisor/QA

1.0 -- 15 February 2013

    - First public release
