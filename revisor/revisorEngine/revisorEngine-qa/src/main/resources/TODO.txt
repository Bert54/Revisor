The normalisation process for extended QC formulas is very innefficient: 
first a list of all possible disjunctive QCNs is created, then impossible 
QCNs are deleted, and finally duplicated QCNs are removed. The complexity of 
the latter two steps is determined by the amount of possible disjuncts, 
which is exponential with respect to the amount of disjunctions. For 
instance, the example DK before cleaning has 13824 QCNs generated. 13776 are 
deleted at step 2, and a further 42 are deleted at step 3. The whole process 
takes about 8Â s. For little extra cost, those steps could be integrated into 
the first step.
